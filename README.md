# Algorithms for Artificial Intelligence
This repository contains some search algorithms which is widely used within AI. This repo has the following: 
## Search Algorithms
<ul>
<li><code>Best-First Search</code></li>
<li><code>Uniform-Cost Search</code></li>
<li><code>A* Search</code></li>
</ul>

## The Genetic Algorithm
Following these searches, the <code>Genetic Algorithm</code> is used for optimizations and search problems. It is based on the biological process of evolution.
