This repository contains some search algorithms which is widely used within AI. This repo has the following: 
## <a href='Best-First, Uniform-Cost, A-Star Search/README.md'>Search Algorithms</a>
<ul>
<li><code>Best-First Search</code></li>
<li><code>Uniform-Cost Search</code></li>
<li><code>A* Search</code></li>
</ul>

## <a href='Genetic Algorithm/README.md'>The Genetic Algorithm</a>
Following these searches, the <code>Genetic Algorithm</code> is used for optimizations and search problems. It is based on the biological process of evolution.
