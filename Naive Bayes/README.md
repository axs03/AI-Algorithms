# Naive Bayes Classifier

The Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on Bayes' Theorem. It is widely used for classification tasks due to its simplicity and efficiency.

## Bayes' Theorem
Bayes' Theorem provides a way to calculate the probability of a hypothesis given observed data.

## Assumptions

The "naive" aspect of the algorithm comes from the assumption that all features are independent of each other, which simplifies computation but may not hold true in real-world scenarios.


## Applications

- Spam email detection
- Sentiment analysis
- Document classification
- Medical diagnosis

## Advantages

- Simple to implement
- Works well with small datasets
- Handles both continuous and discrete data
- Efficient for high-dimensional data

## Limitations

- Assumes feature independence, which may not always be true
- Struggles with complex datasets where features are highly correlated
